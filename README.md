# DBux
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mspanc/dbux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mspanc/dbux)

DBux provides bindings for [D-Bus](http://dbus.freedesktop.org) IPC
protocol for the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) programming language.

## Project aims

DBux's aim is to provide low-level GenServer-like pattern to handle interaction
with D-Bus daemon.

It is not going to provide high-level proxy that will magically map
objects/interfaces exported over D-Bus to data structures used in your application.
In my opinion it's a task for an another abstraction layer (read: another project
built on top of DBux).

At the beginning it's going to provide only functionality needed to act as
a client. Exporting interfaces/objects may be added later.

## Status

Project in the early stage of development. API may change without prior warning.

# Sample Usage

```
defmodule MyBus do
  use DBux.Bus

  def start_link(opts) do
    DBux.Bus.start_link(opts)
  end


  def init(opts) do
    {:ok, :session}
  end


  def handle_connected(...) do

  end


  def handle_disconnected(...) do

  end


  def handle_name_acquired(...) do

  end


  def handle_name_error(...) do

  end


  def handle_name_lost(...) do

  end


  def handle_remote_signal(...) do

  end


  def handle_remote_method_error(...) do

  end


  def handle_remote_method_reply(...) do

  end
end
```
